# Survival_analysis

Survival analysis is a model for time until a certain “event.” The event is sometimes, but not always, death. 
For example, you can use survival analysis to model many different events, including:Time the average person lives, from birth.
Time after cancer treatment until death.

Survival analysis focuses on two important pieces of information: Whether or not a participant suffers the event of interest during the study period
(i.e., a dichotomous or indicator variable often coded as 1=event occurred or 0=event did not occur during the study observation period.)

Here ,  I am taking Breast cancer data

Normally, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes protect you from getting certain cancers. But some mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes prevent them from working properly, 
so that if you inherit one of these mutations, you are more likely to get breast, ovarian, and other cancers.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may account for up to 10% of all breast cancers, or 1 out of every 10 cases.

Interpretation : The Number of Risk factor of Women is more than Male.
Women testing “positive” for a BRCA 1 mutation have an 80% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 40% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer.
